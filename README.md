# A-simple-web
This is my very first time upload my project on github! 

A Simple Web is a clean and minimal landing page project built using only HTML and CSS. This project marks my first time uploading and sharing a website on GitHub.

The goal of this project was to practice building a simple, functional landing page while learning the fundamentals of front-end development.

## 🔹 What This Project Is

This project is a simple landing page that includes:

- A clear introduction section
- A contact section with an email link for communication
- A responsive layout structure
- Clean and simple page styling

It is designed as a beginner project to understand how static websites are built and deployed.

## 🔹 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned and practiced:

- Writing structured and semantic HTML
- Styling layouts and components with CSS
- Organizing a small front-end project
- Understanding how static websites work
- Uploading and deploying a project to GitHub Pages
- Managing a project repository for the first time

This was my first real experience publishing a website online.

## 🔹 What I’d Improve Next

For future improvements, I would like to:

- Improve the overall UI/UX design
- Make the site fully responsive for all screen sizes
- Clean up and refactor CSS for better maintainability
- Add animations or transitions for better user experience
- Expand the project with more sections or features
